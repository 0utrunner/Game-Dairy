            <h1>The Games That Made Me</h1>
                <p>I was a military brat growing up, so my family was always on the go. The process was always repeating, make new friends,
                4 years later say goodbye to those friends, and continue the cycle. One thing never left me though, the video games I owned.
                These were like friends I could visit anytime I wanted, and were always up to keep me company, and a lot of them left lasting
                impressions on me and even influenced how I act to this day. This site is a thank you letter to the games that made me.</p>
